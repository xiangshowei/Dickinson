  8 / 10	- Correctness
  
  	Test Name:								Passes	Fails
  	-------------------------------------------------------
	For Candidate Class:
		testDefeatedTrue					X
		testDefeatedFalse					X
		testDefeatedTie						X
		testNotSameParty					X
		testSameParty						X
		testSamePartyUsesEquals				X
	
	For Ballot Class:
		testConstructor						X
		testAddGetCandidate							X
			* In getCandidate you need to use i instead of the 
			candidatePos variable. The way it is you just repeatedly
			check the first candidate.
		testGetCandidateUsesEquals					X
		testVoteForCandidate						X
			* this prints messages incorrectly when the candidate
			is on the ballot.
		testVoteForCandidateNoCandidate		X
		testVoteForCandidateUsesEquals		X
		testVoteForParty							X
			* this prints messages incorrectly when the candidate
			is on the ballot.		
		testVoteForPartyNoCandidates		X
		testVoteForPartyNotUsingEquals		X

  6.5 / 7 	- Code Quality
  		* In Ballot, the voteForCandidate method could be improved by
		invoking the getCandidate method.  This would eliminate the
		duplicate functionality of iterating over the list of candidates
		to find the one with the specified name.
		  
  5 / 5 	- Documentation / Readability
		* Overall well done.  There is a misplaced "end for-loop" comment
		that might be a bit confusing...
		  
  7 / 8	- Testing Quality
		* In the BallotTest class, testing for addCandidate and getCandidate 
  		could be improved by adding more than a single candidate. Testing 
  		with only a single candidate only tests that the candidate will
  		be found if he/she is the first one in the list.
  		
  		* In the BallotTest class, testing voteForCandiate could be improved
  		by adding more than one candidate.  Testing with only a single 
  		candidate only tests that the candidate will be voted for if he/she is
  		the first candidate in the list.
