132 Lab Grading Rubric - Recursion Exercises

 34 / 36	- Correctness

 	PyramidBoxCount											yes	no
	  Base case for even pyramid base size is correct.		X
	  Base case for odd pyramid base size is correct.		X
	  Recursive case is correct.							X

	Exponentiation											yes	no
	  Base case is correct.										X
	  	* Anything rasied to the 0 is 1.  This includes 0 raised to the 0.
	  	
	  Recursive case for even exponent is correct.			X
	  Recursive case for odd exponent is correct.			X

	Array Sum												yes	no
	  Base case is correct.									X

	Sierpinski												yes	no
	  Base case (order 1) is correct.						X
	  Order 2 is correct.									X
	  Order 3 is correct.									X
	  Order 5 is correct.									X
		
  3 / 3 	- Code Quality
	Array Sum												yes	no
	  Uses recursive helper method for better efficiency.	X
	
  2 / 2 	- Documentation / Readability
  	* Having comments for // end-if and // end-if @ line XX in my opinion do not
      add much and may even be problematic during maintenance of a program.  If you add
      some code above the @ line XX would need to be changed in every case.  This likely
      would lead to comments being out of date, incorrect and misleading and thus confusing to readers.
      If the code is properly indented and aligned then the matching brace will clearly 
      indicate the if/for/while etc that it is completing.  This of course is my opinion
      and I know I have seen the convention for such comments used by others - so others 
      may have a different opinion.
