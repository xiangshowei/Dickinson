132 Lab Grading Rubric - Drawable Shapes Reprise

  31 / 34	- Correctness
																												
	Line:													Yes	No	
		Extends Point										X
		Correctly overrides move							X
		Correctly overrides translate						X
		Correctly overrides draw							X
		Makes effective use of inheritance	(2)				X
		
	Text:													Yes	No	
		Extends Point										X
		Correctly overrides draw							X
		Makes effective use of inheritance	(2)				X	
			
	Rectangle:												Yes	No	
		Extends Point										X
		Implements Scaleable								X
		Correctly overrides draw							X
		Makes effective use of inheritance	(2)				X	
				
	Square:													Yes	No	
		Extends Rectangle									X
		Makes effective use of inheritance	(3) [DONE]			X	
		
	* It is not necessary to override the draw method in Square.  If Square
	  otherwise ensures that width and height are the same then the draw
	  method inherited from Rectangle will work just fine!
	  				
	Ellipse:												Yes	No	
		Extends Point										X
		Implements Scaleable								X
		Correctly overrides draw							X
		Makes effective use of inheritance	(2)				X	
				
	Circle:													Yes	No	
		Extends Ellipse										X
		Makes effective use of inheritance	(3)	[DONE]			X	
		
	* It is not necessary to override the draw method in Circle. If Circle
	  otherwise ensures that radii (or width/height) are the same then the draw
	  method inherited from Ellipse will work just fine!
	  		
    Picture / Animation:									Yes	No	
    	Uses one of each shape				(6)				X

		* Nicely done!
		
  5 / 5 	- Code Quality									Yes	No
	Uses super instead of public or protected fields.		X
	
  3 / 3 	- Documentation / Readability
  
  2 / 3	- Testing Quality
 
 	* LineTest should test translation to ensure that the overridden method
 	  works correctly as well as that the call to super is made correctly.
