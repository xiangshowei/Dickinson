132 Lab Grading Rubric - List ADT

  39 / 40	- Correctness
  
	Comp132ArrayList Class												yes no
	  size works correctly on empty/non-empty lists						X
      add/get work with small size lists								X
      add/get work with large lists										X
      remove works at beginning/middle/end of list						X
      insert works at beginning/middle/end of small lists				X
      inserting many items works										X
      removing many items works											X
      set works at beginning/middle/end of list							X
      IndexOutOfBoundsExceptions are correctly thrown					X
	  Passes stress test (2000 random add/insert/remove/set ops)		X
    
	Comp132LinkedList Class												yes no
	  size works correctly on empty/non-empty lists						X
      add/get work with small size lists								X
      add/get work with large lists										X
      remove works at beginning/middle/end of list							X
      	* remove at start did not work correctly.
      insert works at beginning/middle/end of small lists				X
      inserting many items works										X
      removing many items works											X
      set works at beginning/middle/end of list							X
      IndexOutOfBoundsExceptions are correctly thrown					X
	  Passes stress test (2000 random add/insert/remove/set ops)			X
	  	* likely related to remove at start issue.
	
  5 / 5 	- Code Quality												yes	no
  	Array resizing is factored out into helper method					X
  	Index checking is factored out into helper method					X
  	Array may decrease in size as well as increase						X
	Linked List uses tail pointer to make add more efficient			X
	Finding index in linked list is factored out into helper method		X
  
  2 / 3 	- Documentation
  
  3 / 3 	- Testing Quality											yes	no														yes	no
	Comp132ArrayList (and LinkedList) is adequately tested				X
	At least one test makes underlying array double in size				X
	Tests check that exceptions are thrown when invalid index is used	X
