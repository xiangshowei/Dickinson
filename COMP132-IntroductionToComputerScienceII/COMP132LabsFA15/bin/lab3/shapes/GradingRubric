		12 / 12 - Shapes
			2 Shapes implement Drawable 
			1 Shape implements Scaleable
			
		6 / 6 - Picture or Animation is included and works.

  2 / 3 	- Code Quality
  
  	* The DrawableObjectList should not implement the Drawable 
  	  interface. It itself is not Drawable, it just holds a collection
  	  of Drawable objects.
  	  
  3 / 3 	- Documentation / Readability
  
  2 / 3	- Testing Quality
	* Testing for the scale method would be more complete if it included
	  a test with a negative scale factor.

	* When testing removeDrawable it would be better to test removing objects 
	  from several different points in the list.  For example, if you only test removing 
	  from the first spot in the list your test would not detect a bug in which
	  the method always removes the first element rather than the desired element.

	* When testing the scaleAll method it would be better to test it on a list 
	  that contains some Scaleable objects and some that are not Scaleable. If the
	  list contains no non-Scaleable objects the test cannot detect a bug in which
	  the scale method simply tries to scale every element of the list, rather than
	  just the Scaleable ones.
	    
  0 / 0 	- Bonus Features
  		x/1 - Add and test methods for z-order to DrawableObjectList
  		x/2 - Use 2 javax.swing.timers and 2 ActionListeners to animate 2 shapes
  		x/2 - Test the drawAll method (use mock object in test)
  		x/5 - Create Rotatable Interface and make one shape Rotatable
